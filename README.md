# Human-AI Collaboration-2

This dataset is an expansion of our previous release, *[human-ai-collaboration-1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vanta-research/human-ai-collaboration-1).*  This dataset contains the entirety of *human-ai-collaboration-1,* and expands on it further by adding over twice as many collaborative examples than before. 

*Note: It's not recommended to use both datasets simultaneously as there is overlap between the two. Choose 1 or 2 depending on your needs.*

**Dataset Size:** 6,324 entries  
**License:** Apache 2.0  
**Author:** VANTA Research

---

## Overview

This dataset captures authentic human-AI collaboration patterns across diverse domains including:

- **Conversational Problem-Solving:** Multi-turn dialogues tackling complex questions and creative challenges
- **Knowledge Synthesis:** Combining human expertise with AI capabilities to explore topics in depth
- **Reasoning Transparency:** Clear explanation of thought processes, uncertainty acknowledgment, and collaborative exploration
- **Domain Diversity:** Technical topics, creative writing, scientific reasoning, strategic thinking, and more

Each entry is a carefully curated example of effective human-AI collaboration, optimized for training models that can:
- Engage in substantive dialogue
- Acknowledge and explore uncertainty
- Synthesize information from multiple perspectives
- Maintain context and coherence across exchanges
- Collaborate productively toward shared understanding

---

## Dataset Structure

Each entry in the dataset follows a standard conversational format with **thinking tags** that reveal the AI's reasoning process:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Can you help me optimize this Python function for processing large datasets?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "<think>\nThe user needs performance optimization help. I should:\n1. Analyze their current approach for bottlenecks\n2. Suggest concrete improvements with explanations\n3. Ask clarifying questions about their use case\n4. Provide multiple solutions at different complexity levels\n</think>\n\nI'd be happy to help optimize that! To give you the best recommendations, could you share:\n- The current function code\n- Typical dataset size you're working with\n- Any specific performance bottlenecks you've noticed?\n\nIn the meantime, here are common optimization strategies..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Think Tags

A distinctive feature of this dataset is the inclusion of **`<think>` tags** that contain the AI's internal reasoning process before generating the visible response. These tags:

- Show strategic planning and approach selection
- Reveal uncertainty acknowledgment and decision-making
- Demonstrate consideration of user context and needs
- Provide insight into collaborative reasoning patterns

**Training Tip:** You can choose to keep or remove think tags depending on your use case:
- **Keep them** to train models on transparent reasoning and planning
- **Remove them** if you only want the final conversational outputs

### Data Format

- **Format:** JSONL (JSON Lines - one JSON object per line)
- **Character Encoding:** UTF-8
- **Line Endings:** Standard newlines (`\n`)

### Field Descriptions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `messages` | Array | Conversation turn containing user and assistant exchanges |
| `role` | String | Either "user" or "assistant" |
| `content` | String | The actual message content (may include `<think>` tags for assistant responses) |

---

## Key Characteristics

### Quality Attributes

- ✓ **Transparent Reasoning:** Internal `<think>` tags reveal planning, strategy selection, and uncertainty
- ✓ **Coherent:** Responses maintain logical consistency and relevance
- ✓ **Substantive:** Meaningful depth in exploration and explanation
- ✓ **Collaborative:** Genuine dialogue advancing shared understanding
- ✓ **Diverse:** Wide range of topics, styles, and interaction patterns

### Scope of Data

The dataset spans:
- Multiple domains (STEM, humanities, creative, strategic)
- Various conversation lengths (2-turn exchanges to extended dialogues)
- Different reasoning styles (analytical, creative, exploratory, systematic)
- Mixed levels of topic complexity (accessible to specialized)

---

## Usage

### Loading the Dataset

**Python with Hugging Face Datasets:**
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset("huggingface", "vanta-research/human-ai-1962")
```

**Raw JSONL Loading:**
```python
import json

entries = []
with open("human-ai-1962.jsonl", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        entries.append(json.loads(line))
```

**Processing Think Tags:**
```python
import re

def extract_thinking(content):
    """Extract think tags and visible response separately."""
    think_match = re.search(r'<think>(.*?)</think>', content, re.DOTALL)
    thinking = think_match.group(1).strip() if think_match else None
    visible = re.sub(r'<think>.*?</think>', '', content, flags=re.DOTALL).strip()
    return thinking, visible

def remove_think_tags(content):
    """Remove think tags entirely for training without reasoning."""
    return re.sub(r'<think>.*?</think>', '', content, flags=re.DOTALL).strip()

# Example usage
with open("human-ai-1962.jsonl", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        entry = json.loads(line)
        for msg in entry["messages"]:
            if msg["role"] == "assistant":
                thinking, response = extract_thinking(msg["content"])
                print(f"Internal reasoning: {thinking}")
                print(f"Visible response: {response}")
```

**With PyTorch:**
```python
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class HumanAIDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, jsonl_path):
        self.data = []
        with open(jsonl_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            for line in f:
                self.data.append(json.loads(line))
    
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]
```

### Recommended Applications

1. **Reasoning Transparency Training:** Leverage `<think>` tags to train models that show their work
2. **Language Model Fine-Tuning:** Train models on substantive dialogue patterns (with or without reasoning tags)
3. **Chain-of-Thought Learning:** Use internal reasoning to improve model planning capabilities
4. **Dialogue Evaluation:** Benchmark conversational AI systems on collaborative interactions
5. **RLHF Datasets:** Use as reference examples for preference learning
6. **Instruction Following:** Learn nuanced response generation patterns
